    // designed for faster access
    //     3. Derived Containers (stack, queue, priority queue) - derived from sequence and associative containers.


//In sequence containers, we have Vectors, which has following properties:

// Faster random access to elements in comparison to array
// Slower insertion and deletion at some random position, except at the end.
// Faster insertion at the end.
 

// In Lists, we have,

// Random accessing elements is too slow, because every element is traversed using pointers.
// Insertion and deletion at any position is relatively faster, because they only use pointers, which can easily be manipulated.
// In associative containers, every operation except random access is faster in comparison to any other containers, be it inserting or deleting any element.

// In associative containers, we cannot specifically tell which operation is faster or slower, weâ€™ll have to inspect every data structure separately
